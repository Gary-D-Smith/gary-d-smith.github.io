<p>In 2020, with the start of COVID, I had the opportunity to digitize hundreds of family history documents, including dozens of certificates dating back to the 1920’s. Upon further investigation, I found just over 100 certificates, ranging widely in their characteristics. This project is an attempt to further investigate and visualize this range in character.</p>

<p class="list_title">There are a few things that define every certificate:
<br> &emsp; ⍟ <a href="#aspect_ratio">Aspect Ratio</a>
<br> &emsp; ⍟ <a href="#paper_color">Paper Color</a>
<br> &emsp; ⍟ <a href="#font">Font</a>
<br> &emsp; ⍟ <a href="#date">Date</a>
<br> &emsp; ⍟ <a href="#purpose">Purpose</a>
<br> &emsp; ⍟ <a href="#organization">Organization</a>
<br> &emsp; ⍟ <a href="#introduction">Introduction</a>
<br> &emsp; ⍟ <a href="#seal">Seal</a></p>

<p>By averaging or compiling each element, we can build the “most average certificate."</p>

			<p>To start creating an average certificate, we need an average canvas.
			<br><br>Since the physical size was not recorded in the digitization process, it was necessary to normalize the width of the certificates. From there, a simple outline of the aspect-ratio was created in order to compare the dataset.
			<br><br>Visually, we can see how most of the certificates are landscape, and from additional data (not shown), can confirm this is not a recent trend. For the past century, landscape certificates have dominated.
			<br><br>Specifically, the most popular (mode) ratio for certificates is 3x4.</p>

	<!-- <h5>Paper color of the certificates in chronological order</h5> -->
	<p>Visualized above is the paper color of the certificates in chronological order. The colors range from dark browns to pale reds. By calculating the average RGB value from from the set, a clear trend from light tan to near-perfect white can be identified as time progresses. The average of all the certificate colors results in a neatrual tan.</p>

	<p>Almost every certificate uses a different title font. While classic, <span style="font-family:Old English Text; margin: 0;">Old English Text</span> shows up more than others, the variety of title typefaces is truly immense. That can be best captured through the "average" typefaces shown below, which compile these varying glyphs into a couple sets of characters – one for the 1900s and one for the 2000s.</p>

	<p>By investigating the typefaces above, we can see how certificate design has grown more friendly to <span style="font-family:Helvetica-bold; margin: 0;">sans-serif</span>, in constast to the heavy representation of <span style="font-family:Old English Text; margin: 0;">Blackletter</span> in the 1900s. It is also notable to see the consistent inclusion of some <span style="font-family:Times; margin: 0; font-weight:bold">serif</span> glyphs in both typefaces.</p>

	<p>Dating back to the 1920s, this dataset of certificates cover over a century of documents. Shown below, without even looking at the purpose of each certificate, the waves in the timeline help us infer that schooling is significant in the identity of most certificates. From the 1940s when my grandparents were in school, to the 1980s when my parents were in school, and now to the 2020s, defining my start of high school – a majority of the certificates are awarded during school.</p>
	<div class=simple_center style="margin-bottom: 50px;">
		<img src="./Media/certificate-years.jpg" width="80%" class="img_shadow">
	</div>
	<p>To further support the importance of school, we can also look at the months the certificates were awarded. While there is a healthy distribution, a considerable amount of the dataset was awarded in the Spring and especially the month of May. This, again, supports the inference that most of the certificates result from school, which usually wraps up for the year around May.</p>

	<p>If we average all of these dates, the average date can be calculated:</p>

<div class="average_section" id="purpose">
	<object data="./Media/purpose.svg" width="40%"> </object>
	<p>The purpose of each certificate ranged in complexity from "Graduation" to "Egg Drop Contest Winner." From these broad pruposes, I grouped the certificates into 8 larger categories, shown below. Once again, the academic category pervails, also representaed somewhat in the memberbership category, which included academic societies.
	<br><br><em>Note:</em> The "Goverment" category includes certificates for birth, marriage, and military service. The "Other" category includes purposes like "promotion" and "health."</p>

<div class="average_section" id="organization">
	<object data="./Media/organization.svg" width="40%"> </object>
	<p>The Organizations represented on the certificates also ranged considerably – from "The Oklahoma State Dental Association" to the "Limestone Elementary," and even the "Texas Readers Club." The words of these various organizations are broken up and arranged into the word cloud shown below. Clearly, the academic theme continues to dominate, but it also helps to see some other themes, like location. Clearly, many of these certificates were issued in cities in my home state of Oklahoma. </p>
	<div class=simple_center>
		<object data="./Media/word-cloud.svg" width="80%"> </object>
	</div>
	<p>To calcualte this average, I gave each of these organizations to
		<a href="https://app.inferkit.com/demo" target="_blank">an AI</a>, which generated dozens of new (and often nonsensical) organizations informed by the organizations I already had. Some of the more sensical ones included the "National Children's League," "American Booksellers," and perfectly average "Oklahoma Science Association."</p>

<div class="average_section" id="introduction">
	<object data="./Media/introduction.svg" width="40%"> </object>
	<p>Every certificate has a professional “introduction statement” that either states its purpose or adresses the viewer. Some are pretty funny, like:</p>
	
	<h4>
		&emsp; ⁍ &ensp; Know ye that the Worthy Noble
		<br> &emsp; ⁍ &ensp;  To whom these presents shall come
		<br> &emsp; ⁍ &ensp;  Hace contestar por este certificado que
		<br> &emsp; ⁍ &ensp;  Know Ye that the well beloved brother
		<br> &emsp; ⁍ &ensp;  Know all men by these presents
	</h4>

	<p style="margin-top: 80px">However, most were short and simple, with “This is to certify that” appearing in 19 of the certificates, and “This certifies that” appearing in another 15.</p>
	<div class="simple_center" style="margin-bottom: 50px">
		<object data="./Media/statement-vis.svg" width="40%"> </object>
	</div>

	<p>After giving 
	<a href="https://app.inferkit.com/demo" target="_blank">the same AI</a> all of these phrases and asking it to write another one, we get the average introduction for our certificate:</p>

<div class="average_section" id="seal">
	<object data="./Media/seal.svg" width="40%"> </object>
	<p>The most intersting part of any certificate is usually its seal. Something about the ambitious-complexity of the illustrations, contained in a 1-2 inch circle, is a timeless and recognizable format for conveying professionalism. As you can see in the collage of the seals below, however, not all abide by this standard format, yet they maintain their interst and sense of officiality.</p>
	<div class=simple_center>

	</div>
	<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; width: 84%;">
	<p style="margin-right: 100px;">I find it most natural to begin investigating this dataset with a comparison of the seals' shapes. While typical portrails of seals tend to assume a zig-zag shape, like those pictured in the first block, the data shows that most seals are actually <em>circular</em>. This includes the Princeton seal, used to officialize the univeristy's most important documents. There remains a healthy representation of odd-shaped or free-formed seals, as well, especially prevelent in the certificates from the 2000s.</p>
	<img style="width: 210px; height: 200px; margin:0px;" src="./Media/pton-seal.jpg">
	</div>
	<div class=simple_center>
		<img src="./Media/seal-shape-vis.png" width="80%">
	</div>
	<p>The next visualization tells us a bit more about the dominant seal categories. We can see how most gold seals are zig zag, and most B&W certificates are circular. This results from the mediums in which they are created – while B&W certificates can be printed on and by almost any material, gold seals must be created  with specialty foil paper, which is then cut to shape, explaing the difference in shape and color between the two. The rest fall into the multicolor category, most of which result from the more recent adoption of color printers to make certificates</p>
	<div class=simple_center>
		<img src="./Media/seal-color-vis.png" width="80%">
	</div>
	<p>Last, it is intersting to shown the similarities in the few seals that include ribbons. These usually accompany a sticker (zig zag) seal, and add an element of specialty to the cetficate.</p>
	<div class=simple_center>
		<img src="./Media/seal-ribbon-vis.png" width="80%">
	</div>
	<p>Taking inspiration from the majority of the seals, a lot of which are ambitiously-complicated for thier small size, I created an average seal for the "Oklahoma Science Association." At its core, it is a B&W, circular seal, which we identified as the average, earlier. To this base, I added other elements that repeated in many of the seals. Essential to every seal is radial text, which I made sure to include with the title and date of the certificate alongside equally charactertistic radial patterns. To these outlines, I then created an illustrated science crest, admittedly far too complicated for its realistic size.</p>

	<p>Just like that, and with a couple extra bonus elements (like a signautre and some dingbats), we have the individually-calculted, "Most Average Certificate."
